features:
  - Added a new config option `filter_schedule_stochastic`. This is a global
    option which causes the scheduler to randomly choose pools when
    scheduling, if the filter scheduler is used. The random probabilities
    are proportional to the weights, so higher weighted pools are chosen
    more frequently, but not all the time. By default the old behavior is
    used, where the highest weighted pool is chosen every time.
